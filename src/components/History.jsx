   <h1> Buckle up for a quick trip down the burger lane!</h1> <p>The humble burger's tale began in the early 20th century, with Louis Lassen serving what's 
    believed to be the first hamburger in 1900 at his Connecticut restaurant. Fast forward through the post-World War II boom in fast food, and 
    the burger skyrocketed to stardom. American chains like McDonald's played a leading role, taking the burger global. In India, the burger's rise is a 
    flavorful fusion of globalization, urbanization, and a growing appetite for quick, tasty bites. Today, the burger stands as a symbol of convenient
     dining, uniting taste buds worldwide in a delightful symphony of buns and patties. üçî‚úàÔ∏è</p>
